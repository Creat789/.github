# Security Policy

## What?

This is the external organisation-wide security policy for Government Digital Service (GDS). There are cyber security and information assurance teams, as well as security-conscious people within the programmes, that assess and triage all reported vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

GDS are advocates of responsible vulnerability disclosure. If you’ve found a vulnerability, great! We would like to know so we can fix it.

- If you believe a vulnerability affects the data (release of sensitive data or personal identifiable information) of a system: 
  - Send all details to [disclosure@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk]
  - Prefix your subject with `[Vulnerability]`
  - GDS use ZenDesk as a ticketing system, so you may get a reply or response from that platform


- For all other vulnerabilities, you can leave an issue against the repository:
  - (if you are not sure about which repository to raise an issue against, you can still email details through to [disclosure@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk])
  - Prefix the issue title with `[Vulnerability]`
  - Label the issue `vulnerability`
  - Add details to the issue about the impact and any related OWASP categories
  - It’s preferable not to include exploitation details publically, GDS may contact you via your GitHub profile (alternatively, you can leave other contact means)
